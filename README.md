# what is isolation in flutter
<p>In Flutter, isolation refers to the ability to isolate a block of code and run it on a separate thread or isolate, which is an independent unit of execution. This is useful when you want to perform a long-running task, such as processing large amounts of data or downloading files, without blocking the main thread of the application and making it unresponsive.

By running code on a separate isolate, you can ensure that the UI remains responsive and continues to respond to user input, while the isolated code runs in the background. Isolates communicate with each other through message passing, which allows them to exchange data and synchronize their state.

Flutter provides the Isolate class to create and manage isolates. You can create a new isolate using the spawn method of the Isolate class, passing in the function to be executed in the isolate as an argument. Once the isolate is created, you can communicate with it using the SendPort and ReceivePort classes to send and receive messages.

Overall, isolation in Flutter is a powerful feature that allows you to write more performant and responsive applications by leveraging multiple threads or isolates to run code in parallel.</p>
